## Generative Music Vanilla Javascript.

Creates an ever evolving soundscape, gradually mutating components and shifting into different keys.

Works by constructing chords using a simple interval stacking method, then rearranging them to different octaves to create inversions.

Tries to obey voice leading rules, omiting minor ninths, and minimize movements of each voice to maintain smoothness and consistency.
